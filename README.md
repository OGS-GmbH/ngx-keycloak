This repository hosts an npm package that offers a streamlined interface for integrating Keycloak into Angular applications.

It wraps the complexity of Keycloak’s JavaScript adapter and provides Angular-friendly services and utilities for handling authentication flows, token lifecycle management, role-based access control, and session handling.

The package is designed to simplify secure communication between Angular frontends and Keycloak-secured backends, promoting cleaner code and easier maintenance.
